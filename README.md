A website displaying some React frontend mini-projects.

Website url: https://erezpre-react-app.netlify.app/

Each page is a different theme project:

- Cocktails: demonstrating the use of The Cocktail DB. The user can type
  whichever cocktail he wants in the search bar and get a list of
  cocktails accordingly (e.g. use types "green" - gets all cocktails
  with the word "green" in their names).
- Fast Food Chains: I selected 3 random food chains in Tel Aviv area and displayed
  them on a map using Leaflet API. The user chooses a food chains
  (toggle options) and the map shows 3 branches of the selected food
  chain in Tel Aviv area (click on the chain's logo to see details
  on the specific branch chosen).
